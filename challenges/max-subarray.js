/* You are given an array of integers with both positive and negative numbers. Write a function to
 * find the maximum sum of all subarrays. A subarray is a section of consecutive elements from the
 * original array. The whole array can be considered a sub array of itself.
 *
 * For example: maxSubarray([1, -2, 3, 10, -4, 7, 2, -5]) -> 18 from [3, 10, -4, 7, 2]
 *              maxSubarray([15,20,-5,10])  -> 40
 *
 * input: {array} of integers- positive & negative
 * output: {number} that is a maximum sum of all subarrays (a section of consecutive elements)
 * approach:
 * 
 * Kadane's Algorithm
 *
